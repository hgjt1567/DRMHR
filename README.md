Dynamic robots are becoming an increasingly popular technology. One application for these dynamic robots is replacing humans in dangerous situations. Such situations include a nuclear disaster where a robot could assess the fallout and gather vital information of scientists and clean-up crews. Another less intense situation is in an oil plant where routine inspections are necessary. A robot equipped with various instruments and sensors could do the job more efficiently than a human inspector, and if anything were to go wrong in the plant, the robot could be easily replaced. Several companies are developing robots to fulfill these roles, such as Boston Dynamics. In this application, most robots must have legs in order to go up stairs, avoid obstacles, and climb debris. However, complex control systems and limited actuator technology have restricted how fast legged robots can move. Being fast is important in disaster situations where time is valuable. The purpose of this project is to design and create a dynamic, legged robot that is capable of walking over obstacles and rough terrain, as well as moving quickly over smooth ground.
